Axis coordinate system choice.
The general tendency is to use the Z-axis collinear with the
beam axis (usually lying on the horizontal plane), and then
select the vertical and horizontal axis. Flair prefers the
following convention:
- X horizontal axis, pointing to the left, with respect
    to beam direction
- Y vertical axis, pointing upwards
- Z beam axis, usually horizontal

All the project frames can be accessed with various ways:
  i. by selecting the appropriate node in the project tree;
 ii. with the function F2 - F9 keys.
iii. with the tool bar buttons
 iv. From the menu item View
  v. F4 launches the Geometry Editor

During input editing there are two modes:
 i. Card mode where you can manipulate the cards as a single
    object i.e. Move, delete, insert, copy, paste.
ii. Field editing mode, to modify the contents of a card.
To start editing the fields of a card, first select the card
with the Up/Down arrows or Ctrl-F (Find) and press ENTER-key
to start the field editing mode. To exit editing press
ESCAPE-key, and you will return to Card mode.

The card display at the bottom of the Input Editing screen
will start to fill in with the values as you type them,
highlight with yellow the changes from the previous state.
The values are always written in floating point format.

In all flair list boxes you can key-in the starting
characters of the item you are searching and it will
highlight the first match

"Change To" commands change the type of card, while at the
same time trying to keep as much as possible from the whats.
All exceeding whats in the new type will be discarded.

When changing a body name, region name, material, or
detector all cards that refer to this name will be changed
also.

To add a comment on a card, right click the card and select
Insert Comment or from the Input menu select the
Insert Comment.

Is always a good practice to avoid touching (co-planar)
bodies in FLUKA. Either try to cut the objects with the use
of infinite planes, or slightly overlap the bodies and then
performing the appropriate logical operation in the region
definition.

In geometry debugging is a good practice not to use even
numbers as number of steps.

Flair is trying to peak up the run information only by
looking the status of the output files. It doesn't make use
of the process information.

The Stop button will try to make a clean stop by creating a
fluka.stop file in the running directory.

The Kill button will try to issue a kill -SIGHUP command to
the running process. If you are using a batch system then
you have to substitute the kill command with the appropriate
program.

The Attach button tries to re-attach to the running process
in the case that flair failed to attach correctly, or lost
the running status.

The Refresh button can be used to update the progress
information at any moment.

The use of FLUKA code must be acknowledged explicitly by
quoting the set of references found in the FLUKA manual.
The use of FLAIR should be acknowledged by using the
reference to the manual or to the web site.

"Insert" key while editing a REGION shows a searchable
list of bodies to select from.

Lists in flair are searchable. Type the beginning of the
item you are looking for and the closest match will be
highlighted. Spacebar or Ctrl-N or Ctrl-G repeats the last
search.

Control-Space or Mouse Right-clicking on a card or on a
listbox you a pop-up menu with the most import actions

You can filter all cards related to a specific
material/region/body/detector by simply RIGHT-clicking on
the card and accessing the filter sub-menu.

By pressing the "Insert" key or the [+] button on the
toolbox, while editing the REGION expression you can insert
a body.

If you want to view the source particle distribution or
superimposed on the geometry, make a test run by assigning
all regions to BLCKHOLE material and use a USERDUMP card
scoring only the source particles.

Menu item "Filter Invalid", will show only the cards with
errors in their definition

Menu item "Append Input", can append cards divided in
categories from other input files in the present input.

Geometry can be used either from an external file or from
another input file. In the Project frame "Geometry:" field.

Menu item "Show Errors" (or by right-clicking) displays a
small description of the errors on the present card.

Control-Enter performs the default action of the frame.
For example in Input Editor it adds a new card, in the
Run Control it executes the run, and in Plot it creates
the plot.

To force a square aspect ratio on geometry plots enter 1
in the ratio entry

New window allows to work on multiple projects and
exchanging information

To import parts from another input file or project, use the
import menu command or open the other project on a separate
window

In the Compile frame the "F" button allows the user to copy
the default user routines from usermvax directory to the
project directory. Furthermore the "Scan Input" button will
scan all cards inside the Input if they request an external
user routine

In the Plot List frame the "Filter" button scans the data
files that are generated by the run and proposes one default
plot for each data file

In some frames like "Usr-1d" and "Run" by selecting multiple
detectors or runs the fields are disabled. By right clicking
you can enable/disable the field and modify the information
for all selected items.

In all file dialogs, in the file entry you can enter
a pattern do display e.g. *source*

The automatic names of data merged output files is fully
customizable in the preferences dialog

When new scoring cards are added in an existing input the
Data Merging panel will not automatically detect them. Press
the "gear" button to rescan the input file.

Pressing the database button in the "Compile Executable"
frame, flair can scan your input for the need of user
routines and copy them directly from the $FLUPRO/usermvax
directory

When inserting a card inside a block of "hidden" cards,
flair will try to detect the best place to introduce the new
card.

Change the "Display" value in the all "Plot" header for
displaying the results in multiple windows

Ctrl-Enter executes the default action for each frame
(highlighted with light yellow background)

In the "Plot List" frame, there are two types of "Double
click". Slow (more than a 1s between the two clicks) and
Fast. With slow you can edit the item selected and with fast
it will display the respective panel

You can export your input file to MCNP format or import a
MCNP format as FLUKA from
   File->Export->Mcnp
   File->Import->Mcnp

Double click on the card tag:
- Normal card: selects all similar cards
- Preprocessor: selects conditional-block of cards
- Hidden Card: displays hidden cards

When multiple similar cards are selected, modifying one
value will be cloned on all selected cards

GeometryEditor: All important shortcuts are located in
the right hand side of the keyboard. Check the manual.

GeometryEditor: [Shift] selects a region or aligns to grid

GeometryEditor: [Esc] cancel or unselect in the following
order.
  i. Cancel current action
 ii. Unselect any selected body/objects
iii. Unselect any selected zone

GeometryEditor: [Control] toggles the selection or swaps the
action (e.g. middle button to pan with Control to rotate)

GeometryEditor: Bodies and objects are not by default
visible. Select them first and click on (v) to toggle the
visibility

GeometryEditor: To edit a region remember:
  i. Switch on the "Edit" mode
 ii. Either select the zone you want to modify or
     unselect any zone [Esc] to add a new one
iii. Select the bodies that are involved in the zone
     definition
 iv. Click the "define zone" [d] and click one point inside
     the zone you want to (re)define
  v. Repeat from ii-iv
 vi. Click on Edit to stop the editing mode

GeometryEditor: You can visualize the location and the bin
size of USRBINs as checkerboxes by adding a layer and
selecting a USRBIN from the input

GeometryEditor: You can visualize any region quantity like
importance-biasing, emf thresholds, dpa thresholds etc. by
creating an appropriate layer and selecting the value to
display. Don't forget to set also the color range

GeometryEditor: Technical drawings can be superimposed on
the geometry with the Image layer. Very useful feature to
check for correctness the geometry

GeometryEditor: 3D layer can be combined with the USRBIN
layer

Easter egg: Go to "Input" frame and double click with the
middle button on the card interpretation at the bottom of
the screen
